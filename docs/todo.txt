- can't Cons onto []
- should [] == nil ?
- Reverse doesn't work
- list_eq / list_neq

- parameter checking (arity and type) of all cases in eval()
- re-introduce full funcall support (e.g. fn()())
- returning a function not working correctly
- unit tests
- strings
- unary minus
- Type function, i.e. if (Type(a) == Bool), Integer(x), Bool(x), etc
- paranthesis in operators to change precedence
- gc!
- tail call elimination!
- closures! - do they make sense? environments live with functions?
- reflection support
