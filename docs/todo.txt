- reduce -> fold ?
- document Primers operators
- remove the stack?
- reimplement every, any, sum, product in terms of reduce
- like named parameters in function calls cause conflict
- memory corruption - most apparent on Windows
- tests for nested calls (map, filter, reverse, etc)
- shadowing a previously lifted binding should replace the lifted version
- concatenating the same string variable onto itself creates an infinite value...
- re-introduce line numbers, respecting file/module name and position
- parameter checking (arity and type) of all cases in eval()
- re-introduce full funcall support in parser -> e.g. [x]()
- returning a value and not using it sometimes causes a crash (test case?)
- list evaluation involves lots of copying
- constructed strings print out as lists: 'a' ++ 'b' ++ 'c'
- smarter dispatch of built-in functions (Michael's suggestion)
- should attempted redefinition of a binding in the same scope throw an error?
- full pretty printer (not all forms are covered yet)
- math functions (sin, cos, tan, abs, etc)
- gc
- repl?
- currying?
- lazy evaluation?
- pattern matching?
