  <h1>Primer</h1>
  <hr/>
  <p>
  This site is about Primer, a simple functional programming
  language.
  </p>
  <p>
  Primer was made for fun. It was designed to have the
  features I liked from my favourite languages like Scheme
  and Haskell while avoiding the parts which frustrated me. The
  result so far is an immutable language with lexical scope, closures
  and tail call elimination.
  </p>
  <p>
  Primer isn't finished yet and will never be a truly practical
  language for boring enterprise programming; there's enought of those
  already! If you have any comments or questions in the meantime then please feel free to 
  <a href="mailto:philip.armitage@gmail.com">email</a> me.
  </p>
  <p>
  To see how code looks in Primer, here's an implementation of Quicksort:
  </p>
  <pre>
sort = lambda (l)
    if l then sort(filter(lt, xs)) ++ [x] ++ sort(filter(gte, xs))
    else [] end
    where x = head(l)
          xs = tail(l)
          lt = lambda (a) a < x end
          gte = lambda (a) a >= x end
end
</pre>
</div>
</body>
</html>
