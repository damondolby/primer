Primer is a simple language designed to introduce the basics of functional
programming in a single afternoon.

Until we reach a v1.0 release, Primer is only available in source form
from github. Clone the repository, switch to the Primer directory and type

    make

You must have GNU make, gcc, flex and bison installed. Primer has been tested
on Linux, MacOS X and Windows.

Primer relies upon the environment variable PRIMER_LIBRARY_PATH being set
on your system. This should point to the path containing the file Library.pri
and should be terminated with a '/' e.g. with bash

    export PRIMER_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/phil/Primer/

Primer scripts are run by issuing the command ./primer File.pri. To run the
tutorial issue the command

    ./primer Tutorial.pri

from the directory where Primer is installed.
