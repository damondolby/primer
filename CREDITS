Primer was designed and implemented by Phil Armitage.

Michael Ben-Yosef provided invaluable input into the design of both the
language and the tutorial. His ability to debug Primer code without a
working copy of the interpreter is quite extraordinary.

Damon Dolby tested several releases of the code and tolerated numerous
incompatible changes to the syntax of the language which broke his
programs.
