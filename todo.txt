- concatenating the same string variable onto itself creates an infinite value...
- add filename to nodes (for error handling?)
- consistent parameter naming and ordering for standard library functions
- parameter checking (arity and type) of all cases in eval() -> use mkerr()
- re-introduce full funcall support in parser -> e.g. [x]()
- 4 shift/reduce errors introduced by unary minus
- strings still seem to cause some problems on Windows
- returning a value and not using it sometimes causes a crash?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- gc!
- optimise list eval (currently evaluates each item and reconstructs to avoid non-evaluating symbols)
- should attempted redefinition of a binding in the same scope throw an error?
- printer for lambdas (e.g. full pretty printer)
