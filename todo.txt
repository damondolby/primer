- tests for nested calls (map, filter, reverse, etc)
- shadowing a previously lifted binding should replace the lifted version
- concatenating the same string variable onto itself creates an infinite value...
- add filename to nodes (for error handling?)
- parameter checking (arity and type) of all cases in eval() -> use mkerr()
- re-introduce full funcall support in parser -> e.g. [x]()
- 3 shift/reduce errors introduced by unary minus
- returning a value and not using it sometimes causes a crash?
- list evaluation involves lots of copying
- smarter dispatch of built-in functions (Michael's suggestion)
- GC
- include / using / library loading facility
- REPL?
- should attempted redefinition of a binding in the same scope throw an error?
- printer for lambdas (e.g. full pretty printer)
- printing lists of strings is broken
