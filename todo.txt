- proper hashtable implementation for environments
- shadowing a previously lifted binding should replace the lifted version
- environment_delete is never called
- use END in function and IF blocks to signal potential cleanup?
- concatenating the same string variable onto itself creates an infinite value...
- add filename to nodes (for error handling?)
- parameter checking (arity and type) of all cases in eval() -> use mkerr()
- re-introduce full funcall support in parser -> e.g. [x]()
- 3 shift/reduce errors introduced by unary minus
- strings still seem to cause some problems on Windows
- returning a value and not using it sometimes causes a crash?
- smarter dispatch of built-in functions (Michael's suggestion)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- gc!
- closures!
- REPL?
- optimise list eval (currently evaluates each item and reconstructs to avoid non-evaluating symbols)
- should attempted redefinition of a binding in the same scope throw an error?
- printer for lambdas (e.g. full pretty printer)
