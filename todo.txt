- concatenating string *variables* and printing them goes into an infinite loop!
- string allocation is currently a fixed array!
- add filename to nodes (for error handling?)
- consistent parameter naming and ordering for standard library functions
- parameter checking (arity and type) of all cases in eval() -> use mkerr()
- re-introduce full funcall support (e.g. fn()()) in parser
- printer for lambdas (e.g. full pretty printer)
- 2 shift/reduce errors introduced by unary minus
- gc!
- tail call elimination!
- optimise list eval (currently evaluates each item and reconstructs to avoid non-evaluating symbols)
- should attempted redefinition of a binding in the same scope throw an error?
