Bugs
----
- lazy evaluation of destructured parameters across applications
- memory corruption - most apparent on Windows
- parameter checking (arity and type) of all cases in eval

Missing features
--------------
- GC
- full pretty printer (not all forms are covered yet)
- math functions (sin, cos, tan, abs, etc)

Library
------
- what should any and all actually do?

Nice to have
----------
- re-introduce full funcall support in parser -> e.g. [x]()
- reimplement every, any, sum, product in terms of reduce
- shadowing a lifted binding should replace the lifted version
- better error messages throughout (description + line number)
- smarter dispatch of built-in functions (Michael's suggestion)
- string evaluation is inefficient and shouldn't be necessary
- constructed strings print out as lists: 'a' ++ 'b' ++ 'c'

Tests
-----
- mutual recursion
- nested calls (map, filter, reverse, etc)
- general improved coverage

Documentation
-------------
- operators
- use Michael's any definition
- document booleans, esp wrt []

Possible future enhancements
--------------------------
- repl
- currying
